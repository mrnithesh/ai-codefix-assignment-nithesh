CWE ID & Name: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Vulnerability: Attacker injects malicious script code (typically JavaScript) into a web application, which is then executed in a victim user's browser.
Recipe (Fix): Apply context-aware output encoding to ALL user-controllable data immediately before rendering it in the HTML, or use modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Vue) that encode by default.
